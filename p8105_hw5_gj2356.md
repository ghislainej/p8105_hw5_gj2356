## PROBLEM 1

The code chunk below reads in the Washington Post homicide data, and
creates a new variable `city_state` that combines the city and state
information.

``` r
urlfile = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide = read_csv(url(urlfile)) |>
          janitor::clean_names() |>
          mutate(
            city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")
          )
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

There are 52179 observations and 13 variables in the homicide dataset
detailing homicides in 50 states over a 10 year period (January 2007 to
December 2017). Variables include date of homicide (`reported_date`),
name of victim (`victim_last` and `victim_first`), victim demographics
(`victim_race`, `victim_sex`, and `victim_age`), where the crime
occurred (`city`, `state`, `city_state`, `lat`, `long`), as well as the
status of the case - whether the case is open or closed and if there has
been an arrest (`disposition`).
